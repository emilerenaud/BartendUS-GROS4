#Reduce the resolution (the lower it is, the easier it is)

#Declaration of the background value (RGB or Grayscale) and threshold value


#Detection of the first value over the threshold

#Verification of every neighbors and their neighbors if the value is true (higher than the threshold)


#Average of all the pixel value (x and y separated)  *the average is the center

#Continue for the rest of the pixel

####After scanning everything

#Decide of your origin (one of the dot)


#Calculate the offset of each point from the origin

#Compare the offset to your phisical value

#Calculate the rotation matrix 

#Calculate the scalling matrix
